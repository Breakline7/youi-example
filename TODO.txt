1.) Standardize Scala.js generation via SBT plugin
    - output "application.js" to "jvm/src/main/resources/app/" path
    - convenience functionality to inject Scala.js file into a handler
2.) Communication.connection should have a default implementation to avoid expecting it as an implementation
3.) Remove the necessity of SinglePageApplication by making optional configuration in the application
4.) Provide a mechanism to need only extend ExampleApplication and Client/Server Application
5.) Remove necessary `cached` method implementation in ClientApplication
6.) Remove "main" method requirement entirely and use Profig as launching point
7.) Provide support in Screen to leverage io.youi.http for path matching functionality (URLMatcher)
